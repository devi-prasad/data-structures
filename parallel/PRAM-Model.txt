PRAM Model

In the Parallel Random Access Machine model, all processors are connected to a
global shared memory.

All processors are assumed to work  synchronously on a common clock.

Communication between processots takes place only through the shared memory.

A data from processor Pi is communicated to processor Pj in the following
steps:
    (1) processor Pi writes data to the shared memory location.
    (2) processor Pj reads data from the shared memory location.

There are four different types of configurations possible:
    EREW
    CREW
    ERCW
    CRCW

CW is problematic if not handled with care. Three different methods may be used
to resolve conflicts:
    Equality Conflict Resolution
    Priority Conflict Resolution
    Arbitrary Conflict Resolution
